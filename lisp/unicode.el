Unicode file.  The character is called \"ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE\"

  -- it has no displayable representation
  -- due to its semantics it never normally appears at the beginning
     of a stream
  -- its reverse U+FFFE is not a legal Unicode character

  -- All ASCII characters (codepoints 0 through 127) are represented
     by themselves (i.e. using one byte, with the same value as the
     ASCII codepoint), and these bytes are disjoint from bytes
     representing non-ASCII characters.

     This means that any 8-bit clean application can safely process
     UTF-8-encoded text as it were ASCII, with no corruption (e.g. a
     '/' byte is always a slash character, never the second byte of
     some other character, as with Big5, so a pathname encoded in
     UTF-8 can safely be split up into components and reassembled
     again using standard ASCII processes).

  -- Leading bytes and non-leading bytes in the encoding of a
     character are disjoint, so moving backwards is easy.

  -- Given only the leading byte, you know how many following bytes
     are present.
