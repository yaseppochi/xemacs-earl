The files in this directory contain source code for the core XEmacs
facilities written in Emacs Lisp.  *.el files are Elisp source, and
*.elc files are byte-compiled versions of the corresponding *.el
files.  Byte-compiled files are architecture-independent.

Functions used only by files in this directory are considered
"internal" and are subject to change at any time.  All commands, and
most functions with docstrings, are part of the exported API.  In
particular, it is considered good style to use the Common Lisp
facilities provided in cl*.el.  (Yes, that's ambiguous.  Sorry, we
don't have a full specification of the API, as the Lispref is
chronically incomplete.  Anything described in the Lispref is part of
the API, of course.)

Libraries which implement applications and enhancements are placed in
the "packages", which are distributed separately from the core
sources.

When XEmacs starts up, it adds certain directories in various
hierarchies containing Lisp libraries to `load-path' (the list of
directories to be searched when loading files).  These are: this
directory, its subdirectory ./mule (in Mule-enabled XEmacs only), the
site-lisp directory (deprecated), and all the lisp/PACKAGE
subdirectories of the xemacs-packages, mule-packages, and
site-packages hierarchies.  See setup-paths.el.

#### Is the following true or relevant any more?
bogus> Directories whose names begin with "-" or "." are not added to
bogus> the default load-path.

Some files which you might reasonably want to alter when installing or
customizing XEmacs at your site are:

	paths.el	You may need to change the default pathnames here,
			but probably not.  This is loaded before XEmacs is
			dumped.

	site-init.el	#### obsolete and removed?
			To pre-load additional libraries into XEmacs and dump
			them in the executable, load them from this file.
			Read the instructions in this file for a description
			of how to do this.

	site-load.el	#### description is obsolete
			This is like site-init.el, but if you want the 
			docstrings of your preloaded libraries to be kept in
			the DOC file instead of in the executable, you should
			load them from this file instead.  To do this, you must
			also cause them to be scanned when the DOC file is
			generated by editing ../src/Makefile.in.in and
			rerunning configure.
			#### new semantics
			This file will preload additional libraries listed in
			../site-packages and dump them into XEmacs.

	../site-packages  List of additional libraries read by site-load.el.

	site-start.el	This is loaded each time XEmacs starts up, before the
			user's .emacs file.  (Sysadmin must create.)  Can be
			inhibited for a given invocation with `--no-site-file'.

	default.el	This is loaded each time XEmacs starts up, after the
			user's .emacs file, unless .emacs sets the variable
			inhibit-default-init to t.  (Sysadmin must create.)
			Can be inhibited for a given invocation with `-q'.

	version.el	This contains the version information for XEmacs.

The only files which remain at top-level are those which you might
reasonably want to alter when installing or customizing XEmacs at your
site.  The files which may appear at top level are:

	paths.el	You may need to change the default pathnames here,
			but probably not.  This is loaded before XEmacs is
			dumped.

	site-init.el	To pre-load additional libraries into XEmacs and dump
			them in the executable, load them from this file.
			Read the instructions in this file for a description
			of how to do this.

	site-load.el	This is like site-init.el, but if you want the 
			docstrings of your preloaded libraries to be kept in
			the DOC file instead of in the executable, you should
			load them from this file instead.  To do this, you must
			also cause them to be scanned when the DOC file is
			generated by editing ../src/Makefile.in.in and
			rerunning configure.

	site-start.el	This is loaded each time XEmacs starts up, before the
			user's .emacs file.

	default.el	This is loaded each time XEmacs starts up, after the
			user's .emacs file, unless .emacs sets the variable
			inhibit-default-init to t.

	version.el	This contains the version information for XEmacs.
