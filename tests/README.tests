XEmacs Test Suite
=================

This directory contains the XEmacs test suite.

Except for the subdirectory automated/, which contains the automated
tests that can be run at build time by `make check', it's rather
disorganized.  Please add documentation on how to run the tests here.

automated/
    These are tests that can be run automatically at build time with
    `make check'.  The test infrastructure is in test-harness.el.

interactive/
    These are tests that either require user input or interpretation
    (such as readability of colors), or need to be confirmed because
    they are related to crashes.  It is planned to have a menu of
    these tests.

DLL/
    Tests for dynamically loadable modules.
    May or may not actually work.

DnD/
    These test the drag'n'drop facilities.
    May or may not actually work.

gtk/
    Tests for the GTK v1 port.

tooltalk/
    Tests for the ToolTalk protocol in Sun Workshop.
    May or may not actually work.

sigpipe.c
    A test for pipe issues by Richard Mlynarik.

auc-tex-test
    A very simple test for AUCTex.
    May or may not actually work.
