### Specialize this part for your module.

## Since "config.h" is included by modules/common/Makefile.common, I
## guess symbols defined there could be referenced in the definitions
## below?

## The MODNAME must be a legal C identifier, and need not be the same as
## the name of the object file.
MODNAME=neon_api

## MODVER may be checked by the module loading code.
MODVER=0.5.0

## A comment for human consumption.
MODTITLE="Interface to libneon for XEmacs"

## The sources for objects to be linked into the module object.
SRCS=$(MODNAME).c

## Any options for the linker other than the output object (usually
## $(MODNAME).ell), the objects to be linked, and a set of standard
## ELL-specific flags.  Library search paths and libraries will usually
## be computed by configure, and then specified here (typically as
## @VAR@ substitutions).
LDFLAGS=@LDFLAGS@ @neon_libs@

## Note: modules/common/Makefile.common will be appended by configure
