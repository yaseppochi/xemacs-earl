This directory contains Unicode translation tables for most of the
charsets in XEmacs.

The tables in unicode-consortium/ come from:

http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/

The tables in ibm/ come from:

http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charset/

The tables in unicode-consortium/ should be used as source data; the ones
in ibm/ can be used to supplement or check the accuracy of the others.
